## Project 10 for the Treehouse FSJS Techdegree

Aiming for an exceeds!

### Combination Views

Rather than combining multiple arrays of data from database, every effort was made to use complex querying of the database to only returned relevant data.

### Validation

Uses only server side validation to show that the sequelize validators are working, normally would use a combination of front side and server side techniques if it were a live project to make sure nothing got through and that the data was sanitized before reaching server.

### Pagination

Once again used server side techniques and the built in sequelize limit/offset for pagination
